# PRDs and Roadmaps

A collection of Product Requirement Documents, user stories, and roadmaps organized by domain. Each PRD uses a consistent structure and links to metrics and delivery plans.

## Folders
- `/fintech/` – lending, KYC, payments
- `/ai-ml/` – LLM assistants, feedback summarization
- `/saas/` – admin dashboards, billing, roles/permissions

## Tips
- Treat each PRD as a mini-case with KPIs and trade-offs.
- Include acceptance criteria and non-functional requirements.
- Keep scope tight and measurable.
